# Prophet-liqour-sales-forecasting-
I created a sales forecasting model using a kaggle dataset of liqour sales from 2012-2016 with facebook's "Prophet" model. Additionally, for this project, I used multiple libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and many others for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

## Sales Forecasting with Prophet
### Introduction

This project uses a Kaggle dataset of liquor sales (2012–2016) to build a robust sales forecasting model using Facebook’s Prophet library. The objective is to uncover seasonal patterns and trends in sales, providing actionable insights and accurate future predictions.

### Tools & Libraries Used
Python – primary programming language
Pandas & NumPy – for data cleaning, transformation, and handling
Matplotlib – for data visualization, trend analysis, and diagnostics
Prophet – for building and tuning the time series forecasting model
Sklearn.metrics - for evaluating quality of predictions made by the model
Statsmodels - for decomposition of our time series
